## Project Description
This project consists of two simple web applications: a calculator web application (Part A) and a stopwatch web application (Part B). These applications are designed to demonstrate basic web development skills, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. Each application meets specific requirements outlined in the assignment.<br>
## Part A: Simple Calculator Web Application
## Features
1. Login Page:<br>
- Contains fields for Email, Username, Password, and Confirm Password, along with a Login Button.<br>
- Validation:<br>
All fields are validated according to standards.<br>
Null checks, special character checks, and length checks are implemented.<br>
Proper error messages are displayed below the fields in red.<br>
- The Email field accepts only Northeastern email addresses.<br>
- The Login button is disabled until all validations are successfully passed.<br>
2. Calculator Page:<br>
- Displays the logged-in username at the top of the page.<br>
- Contains two text fields labeled "Number 1" and "Number 2".<br>
- Four operation buttons: Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide.<br>
- Displays the result in a third, non-editable field.<br>
- Validation:<br>
Null checks, special character checks, and numbers-only checks are implemented.<br>
Error messages are displayed below the fields.<br>
Uses one arrow function for all operations (Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide).<br>
- Basic CSS is applied for layout and visual appeal.<br>
## Part B: Simple Stopwatch Web Application
## Features
1. Single-Page Application:<br>
Displays time in the format "HH:MM:SS", initially showing 00:00:00.<br>
The time label is non-editable.<br>
Contains a date picker to select the current or any past/future date, which is also non-editable.<br>
2. Three Buttons:<br>
Start: Starts the stopwatch.<br>
Stop: Pauses the stopwatch.<br>
Reset: Resets the stopwatch to 00:00:00.<br>
3. Modern JavaScript Features:<br>
Uses Async, Await, Promises, and setInterval/clearInterval for the stopwatch logic.<br>
## How to Run the Project

'git clone [repository_url]'<br>
2. Navigate to the Project Directory:<br>
'cd [project_directory]'<br>
3. Open the HTML Files in a Browser:<br>
For Part A: Open LoginPage.html in a browser.<br>
